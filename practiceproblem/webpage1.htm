        Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or i
        maginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual
        ideas.Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not
        differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century,
        where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and
        distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied
        arts.The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation,
        are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.
        In the perspective of the history of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as
        humankind: from early prehistoric art to contemporary art;  however, some theorists think that the typical concept of "artistic works" does not fit well  outside modern Western societies. One early sense of the definition of art is closely related  to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to
        "skill" or "craft", as associated with words such as "artisan". English words derived
        from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there aremany other
        colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.
        Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art.
        Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses, and  is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness       (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus , and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great  poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses
        in the Republic.  The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today inthe modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary
        art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.  With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy,
        Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and  manner.
        For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and   poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic
        imitation of men worse than    average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of   imitationâ€”through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.
